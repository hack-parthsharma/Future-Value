# Future Value

http://futurevalue.azurewebsites.net/

## Description

An ASP.NET web application that calculates and displays the future value of a 401K. I created this application for an ASP.NET class I completed in community college. I decided to share this project and <a href="http://futurevalue.azurewebsites.net/" target="_blank">host it on Azure</a> as well as share the code here on GitHub.

The application calculates and displays the future value of a 401K account based on the investment amount, annual interest rate, and number of years. You can use the Clear button to clear everything if you make mistake and want to start over.
